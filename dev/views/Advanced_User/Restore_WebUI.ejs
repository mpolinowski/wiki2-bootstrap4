                        <h1>Restore your Camera after a faulty WebUI Upgrade</h1>
                        <p>You updated your camera´s web user interface - but now you are unable to log into your camera with your web browser. You still "see" the camera inside your network and might even be able to access the video stream with our smartphone app. But your web browser simply refuses to open the interface. In this case the webUI was damaged during the installation process and all that needs to be done is updating it a second time. The easiest way to do this, is using the INSTAR Camera Tool, go to the Update tab and load the webUI file onto the camera. But what if this update also fails?</p>
                        <h2>Simple Update Tool HD</h2>

                          You tried to update your HD camera´s software but everything you tried fails and you are no longer able to access the web user interface from your web browser? Use the Simple Updater as a mean of last resort, before grabbing your soldering iron. You can download the updater from <a href="http://wiki.instar.com/images/0/01/SimpleUpdateTool_HD.zip">HERE</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The update tool consists of some simple HTML files and some javascript and CSS. Unpack those files and open the update.html with your default browser. Download the desired update.pkg file for your camera from <a href="http://download.instar.de">HERE</a>. Now upload the file through the update.html to your camera. <strong>The update will take about 300 seconds</strong>.
