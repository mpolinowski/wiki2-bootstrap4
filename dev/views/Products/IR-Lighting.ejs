                        <p class="text-justify">All INSTAR night vision cameras use infrared LEDs that have an emission maximum around 850nm. Photons with a wavelength higher than ~750nm are invisible to the human eye, but still clearly visible to a CMOS sensor. Especially if used indoors, night vision cameras can easily illuminate a small office space. Indoor environments are ideal as walls, furniture, the floor and ceiling reflect huge amounts of IR light back to the camera, allowing you to see every detail of the room clear-as-day. The situation can look very different once you are outside of the building. Green areas like lawns, bushes and trees reflect the incoming light in such a diffuse matter, that only a fracture of the light intensity ever returns to the camera. The result is, that the camera image stays very dark at night. A person or car moving into the surveillance area will again reflect a huge amount of the IR light and will register easily. The problem is, that the camera sees mostly black and automatically increases the exposure time of every image "shot" for the live video stream, causing every tiny movement to blur the object. You often end up being unable to recognize a face or car brand, if they don´t stop for a few seconds in front of the camera for you. How do you get around this problem? Easily! Use an HD camera and install a regular floodlight with a motion switch. HD cameras have a much bigger sensor and catching a lot more light - allowing them to use shorter exposure times, which again leads to less motion blur in your images. The also react a lot faster to changes in the light conditions - if you switch on an external light. VGA cameras will be "blinded" for a while, allowing the subject to leave the surveillance area, while you are still looking at a white screen. </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">But what if you don´t need the HD resolution? What if a regular light is to obvious and you need a more discreet surveillance? The IN-900 Series Infrared Spotlights might just be what you need to supplement your existing cameras. Build to the IP65 Standard they can easily be installed, wherever you have a power outlet available. It is even possible to install them closer to the car, door or whatever is the subject of your surveillance, to focus their light to the area that counts. All models work autonomously via a twilight switch / photodiode, only switching themselves on when it gets dark. And they adjust their power output automatically according to the brightness of the surrounding. The don´t need to be wired to a camera. </p>

The cause for this effect is the decreased sensitivity of the imaging sensor, which is falling rapidly with the increasing wavelength in the IR region. Furthermore, there is an increase in the air’s opacity for light in the range around 900nm. The application of a 940nm spotlight is only recommended, <strong>if an invisible illumination of the observed area is deemed necessary</strong>.</p>
